PythonCyc 1.1, April 2020
============================

Overview
--------

The PythonCyc module provides a Python 3.5+ interface to a Pathway Tools
application running either locally or remotely. This module has been
designed to work on the three platforms supported by Pathway Tools:
Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Pathway Tools version 18.5 or
above is needed to use this module.

This release has been tested under Python 3.5 and 3.7 under Linux and
Mac OSX.  It has not been tested under Windows, or with IPython
or Jupyter.
